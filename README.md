# CloudFlare hook for `dehydrated`

This a hook for [dehydrated](https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated) (a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) ACME client) that allows you to use [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) DNS records to respond to `dns-01` challenges. Requires Python and your CloudFlare account e-mail and API key being in the environment.

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated
$ cd dehydrated
$ mkdir hooks
$ git clone https://github.com/Torkiliuz/dehydrated-cloudflare-hook hooks/cloudflare
$ pip install -r hooks/cloudflare/requirements.txt
```
If using Python 2, replace the last step with the one below and check the [urllib3 documentation](http://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html#installing-urllib3-with-sni-support-and-certificates) for other possible caveats.

```
$ pip install -r hooks/cloudflare/requirements-python-2.txt
```


## Configuration

Your account's CloudFlare email and API key are expected to be in the environment, so make sure to:

```
$ export CF_EMAIL='user@example.com'
$ export CF_KEY='K9uX2HyUjeWg5AhAb'
```

Optionally, you can specify the DNS servers to be used for propagation checking via the `CF_DNS_SERVERS` environment variable (props [bennettp123](https://github.com/bennettp123)):

```
$ export CF_DNS_SERVERS='8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4'
```

Alternatively, these statements can be placed in `dehydrated/config.sh`, which is automatically sourced by `dehydrated` on startup:

```
echo "export CF_EMAIL='user@example.com'" >> config.sh
echo "export CF_KEY='K9uX2HyUjeWg5AhAb'" >> config.sh
```




## Usage

```
$ ./dehydrated -c -d example.com -t dns-01 -k 'hooks/cloudflare/hook.py'
